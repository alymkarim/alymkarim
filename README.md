# 👋 Hi, I'm Alya Karim

🎓 I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Analytics at Technological University of the Shannon (TUS), with a focus on real-world, impact-driven solutions in data science and AI.  
🔬 I hold a BSc (Hons) in Applied Physics from Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), which shaped my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and experimentation mindset.

My journey bridges science and tech — from understanding physical systems to designing data-driven tools that support real-life decisions. I'm especially interested in how data, machine learning, and lightweight AI models can be applied in crisis response, sustainability, and innovation.

Right now, I'm working on my thesis: developing a drone-based human detection system using YOLOv5/YOLOv8 for search and rescue operations. It's all about combining computer vision with practical, field-ready solutions.

When I’m not deep in data, you’ll likely find me:
- 📸 Shooting film photography
- 🎨 Painting (often just for my own walls!)
- ✍️ Journaling or writing
- 🎧 Listening to ambient playlists on Spotify

### 📊 My Data Projects

- 🛸 [**Drone-Based Human Detection for Disaster Management**](https://github.com/alymkarim/UAV_HumanDetection_YOLO) *(in progress)*  
  A practical system for drone-assisted search and rescue using lightweight object detection models (YOLOv5, YOLOv8).  
  Focuses on efficiency for real-time deployment in disaster zones with limited hardware.  
  Datasets: Okutama-Action, VisDrone, UAVDT.

- 🔬 [**Research Project Database System**](https://github.com/alymkarim/Research_Project_Data_System_SQL)  
  SQL-based database system for managing research projects and scientist data across UK & Irish universities.

- 🌍 [**EcoZone Mapper (NASA SpaceApps)**](https://github.com/alymkarim/EcoZone_Mapper_SpaceApps2024)  
  GIS dashboard for waste management and recycling optimization, built for NASA Space Apps 2024.

### 🛸 Featured Research: Human Detection with UAVs

My master's thesis explores how lightweight object detection models (YOLOv5/YOLOv8) can be integrated into UAVs to support real-world search and rescue operations in disaster environments.

This project focuses on:
- Training and evaluating object detection on aerial datasets (Okutama-Action, VisDrone, UAVDT)
- Optimizing for real-time performance on resource-limited drones
- Addressing environmental challenges like smoke, lighting, and terrain
- Exploring ethical issues around privacy and deployment in sensitive contexts
